# Alice-Bob-Cory-Zhao

Description:
Alice and Bob are playing a game similar to Go-Fish. The way they play is that both Alice and Bob start with the same
amount of random cards. Each player has unique cards, but duplicates likely exist. Alice and Bob take turns playing.
Alice goes through her cards from least to greatest (order will be explained), checking if Bob has the card. If a card
is found, then the card will be printed and the card will be removed from both players hands. Now, Bob will go through
his cards from greatest to least, and the process repeats. The game ends when both players do not have any cards in
common and both hands will be printed out. 

Card Ordering:
Suit (least to greatest): clubs, diamonds, spades, hearts
Value (least to greatest): ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... 10, jack, queen, king
